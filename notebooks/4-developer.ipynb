To compare if an given `Executor` class is based on executorlib compare with the `ExecutorBase` class which can be imported as `from executorlib.base.executor import ExecutorBase`.\n* `cache` - the cache module defines the file based communication for the [HPC Cluster Executor](https://executorlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/2-hpc-cluster.html).\n* `interactive` - the interactive modules defines the [zero message queue](https://zeromq.org) based communication for the [Single Node Executor](https://executorlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/1-single-node.html) and the [HPC Job Executor](https://executorlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/3-hpc-job.html).\n* `interfaces` - the different `Executor` classes are defined here, namely `SingleNodeExecutor`, `SlurmClusterExecutor`, `SlurmJobExecutor`, `FluxClusterExecutor` and `FluxJobExecutor`.\n* `standalone` - the standalone module contains a number of utility functions which only depend on external libraries and do not have any internal dependency to other parts of `executorlib`. This includes the functionality to generate executable commands, the [h5py](https://www.h5py.org) based interface for caching, a number of input checks, routines to plot the dependencies of a number of future objects, functionality to interact with the [queues defined in the Python standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html), the interface for serialization based on [cloudpickle](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle) and finally an extension to the [threading](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html) of the Python standard library.\n\nGiven the level of separation the integration of submodules from the standalone module in external software packages should be the easiest way to benefit from the developments in executorlib beyond just using the `Executor` class.

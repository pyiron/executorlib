    "executorlib is designed to work out of the box for up-scaling Python functions and distribute them on a high performance computing (HPC) cluster. Most users should only import the `Executor` class from executorlib and should not need to use any of the internal functionality covered in this section. Still for more advanced applications beyond the submission of Python functions executorlib provides additional functionality. The functionality in this section is not officially supported and might change in future versions without further notice. "

    "The key functionality of the `executorlib` package is the up-scaling of python functions with thread based parallelism, \n",
    "MPI based parallelism or by assigning GPUs to individual python functions. In the background this is realized using a \n",
    "combination of the [zero message queue](https://zeromq.org) and [cloudpickle](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle) \n",
    "to communicate binary python objects. The `executorlib.standalone.interactive.communication.SocketInterface` is an abstraction of this \n",
    "interface, which is used in the other classes inside `executorlib` and might also be helpful for other projects. It \n",
    "comes with a series of utility functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `executorlib.standalone.interactive.communication.interface_bootup()`: To initialize the interface\n",
    "* `executorlib.standalone.interactive.communication.interface_connect()`: To connect the interface to another instance\n",
    "* `executorlib.standalone.interactive.communication.interface_send()`: To send messages via this interface \n",
    "* `executorlib.standalone.interactive.communication.interface_receive()`: To receive messages via this interface \n",
    "* `executorlib.standalone.interactive.communication.interface_shutdown()`: To shutdown the interface\n",
    "\n",
    "While `executorlib` was initially designed for up-scaling python functions for HPC, the same functionality can be \n",
    "leveraged to up-scale any executable independent of the programming language it is developed in."

    "* `base` - the base module contains the definition of the executorlib `ExecutorBase` class which is internally used to create the different interfaces. To compare if an given `Executor` class is based on executorlib compare with the `ExecutorBase` class which can be imported as `from executorlib.base.executor import ExecutorBase`.\n",
    "* `cache` - the cache module defines the file based communication for the [HPC submission mode]().\n",
    "* `interactive` - the interactive modules defines the [zero message queue](https://zeromq.org) based communication for the [local mode]() and the [HPC allocation mode]().\n",
    "* `standalone` - the standalone module contains a number of utility functions which only depend on external libraries and do not have any internal dependency to other parts of `executorlib`. This includes the functionality to generate executable commands, the [h5py](https://www.h5py.org) based interface for caching, a number of input checks, routines to plot the dependencies of a number of future objects, functionality to interact with the [queues defined in the Python standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html), the interface for serialization based on [cloudpickle](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle) and finally an extension to the [threading](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html) of the Python standard library.\n",

    "Given the level of separation the integration of submodules from the standalone module in external software packages should be the easiest way to benefit from the developments in executorlib beyond just using the `Executor` class. "

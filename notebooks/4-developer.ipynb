    "# Support & Contribution\n",
    "The executorlib open-source software package is developed by scientists for scientists. We are open for any contribution, from feedback about spelling mistakes in the documentation, to [raising issues](https://github.com/pyiron/executorlib/issues) about functionality which is insufficiently explained in the documentation or simply requesting support to suggesting new features or opening [pull requests](https://github.com/pyiron/executorlib/pulls). Our [Github repository](https://github.com/pyiron/executorlib) is the easiest way to get in contact with the developers. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Issues\n",
    "The easiest way for us as developers to help in solving an issue is to provide us with sufficient information about how to reproduce the issue. The simpler the test case which causes the issue the easier it is to identify the part of the code which is causing the issue. As a general rule of thumb, everything that works with the [ProcessPoolExecutor](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#processpoolexecutor) \n",
    "or the [ThreadPoolExecutor](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#threadpoolexecutor) should also work with the different Executor classes provided by executorlib. If this is not the case, then it is most likely a bug and worth reporting. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Pull Requests\n",
    "Reviewing a pull request is easier when the changes are clearly lined out, covered by tests and following the automated formatting using black. Still when you decide to work on a new feature it can also be helpful to open a pull request early on and mark it as draft, this gives other developers the opportunity to see what you are working on. \n",

    "## Modules\n",
    "While it is not recommended to link to specific internal components of executorlib in external Python packages but rather only the `Executor` classes should be used as central interfaces to executorlib, the internal architecture is briefly outlined below. \n",
    "* `backend` - the backend module contains the functionality for the Python processes created by executorlib to execute the submitted Python functions.\n",
    "* `executor` - the executor module defines the different `Executor` classes, namely `SingleNodeExecutor`, `SlurmClusterExecutor`, `SlurmJobExecutor`, `FluxClusterExecutor` and `FluxJobExecutor`. These are the interfaces the user interacts with.\n",
    "* `standalone` - the standalone module contains a number of utility functions which only depend on external libraries and do not have any internal dependency to other parts of `executorlib`. This includes the functionality to generate executable commands, the [h5py](https://www.h5py.org) based interface for caching, a number of input checks, routines to plot the dependencies of a number of future objects, functionality to interact with the [queues defined in the Python standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html), the interface for serialization based on [cloudpickle](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle) and finally an extension to the [threading](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html) of the Python standard library.\n",
    "* `task_scheduler` - the internal task scheduler module defines the task schedulers, namely `BlockAllocationTaskScheduler`, `DependencyTaskScheduler`, `FileTaskScheduler` and `OneProcessTaskScheduler`. They are divided into two sub modules:\n",
    "  * `file` - the file based task scheduler module defines the file based communication for the [HPC Cluster Executor](https://executorlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/2-hpc-cluster.html).\n",
    "  * `interactive` - the interactive task scheduler module defines the [zero message queue](https://zeromq.org) based communication for the [Single Node Executor](https://executorlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/1-single-node.html) and the [HPC Job Executor](https://executorlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/3-hpc-job.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the level of separation the integration of submodules from the standalone module in external software packages should be the easiest way to benefit from the developments in executorlib beyond just using the `Executor` class. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Interface Class Hierarchy\n",
    "executorlib provides five different interfaces, namely `SingleNodeExecutor`, `SlurmClusterExecutor`, `SlurmJobExecutor`, `FluxClusterExecutor` and `FluxJobExecutor`, internally these are mapped to four types of task schedulers, namely `BlockAllocationTaskScheduler`, `DependencyTaskScheduler`, `FileTaskScheduler` and `OneProcessTaskScheduler` depending on which options are selected. Finally, the task schedulers are connected to spawners to start new processes, namely the `MpiExecSpawner`, `SrunSpawner` and `FluxPythonSpawner`. The dependence is illustrated in the following table:\n",

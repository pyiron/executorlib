Consequently, the block allocation `block_allocation` and the init function `init_function` are not available in the HPC Cluster Executors. At the same time it is possible to close the Python process which created the `Executor`, wait until the execution of the submitted Python functions is completed and afterwards reload the results from the cache.\n\nInternally the HPC submission mode is using the [Python simple queuing system adatper (pysqa)](https://pysqa.readthedocs.io) to connect to HPC job schedulers and the [h5py](https://www.h5py.org) package for serializing the Python functions to store them on the file system. Both packages are optional dependency of executorlib. The installation of the [pysqa](https://pysqa.readthedocs.io) package and the [h5py](https://www.h5py.org) package are covered in the installation section.

    "# HPC Submission Mode\n",
    "In contrast to the [local mode] and the [HPC allocation mode] the HPC Submission Mode does not communicate via the [zero message queue](https://zeromq.org) but instead stores the python functions on the file system and uses the job scheduler to handle the dependencies of the Python functions. Consequently, the block allocation `block_allocation` and the init function `init_function` are not available in HPC Submission mode. At the same time it is possible to close the Python process which created the `Executor`, wait until the execution of the submitted Python functions is completed and afterwards reload the results from the cache. \n",
    "\n",
    "Internally the HPC submission mode is using the [Python simple queuing system adatper (pysqa)](https://pysqa.readthedocs.io) to connect to HPC job schedulers and the [h5py](https://www.h5py.org) package for serializing the Python functions to store them on the file system. Both packages are optional dependency of executorlib. The installation of the [pysqa](https://pysqa.readthedocs.io) package and the [h5py](https://www.h5py.org) package are covered in the installation section. "

    "The [Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM)](https://slurm.schedmd.com) job scheduler is currently the most commonly used job scheduler for HPC clusters. In the HPC submission mode executorlib internally uses the [sbatch](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html) command this is in contrast to the [HPC allocatiom mode] which internally uses the [srun](https://slurm.schedmd.com/srun.html) command. \n",

All three options are covered in more detail on the [pysqa documentation](https://pysqa.readthedocs.io)."

For the case of the HPC submission these dependencies are communicated to the job scheduler, which allows to stop the Python process which created the `Executor` class, wait until the execution of the submitted Python functions is completed and afterwards restart the Python process for the `Executor` class and reload the calculation results from the cache defined by the `cache_directory` parameter."

This format is design for caching but not for long-term storage. The user is responsible for the long-term storage of their data."

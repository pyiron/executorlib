    "# HPC Allocation Mode\n",
    "In contrast to the [HPC Submission Mode]() which submitts individual Python functions to HPC job schedulers, the HPC Allocation Mode takes a given allocation of the HPC job scheduler and executes Python functions with the resources available in this allocation. In this regard it is similar to the [Local Mode]() as it communicates with the individual Python processes using the [zero message queue](https://zeromq.org/), still it is more advanced as it can access the computational resources of all compute nodes of the given HPC allocation and also provides the option to assign GPUs as accelerators for parallel execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Available Functionality: \n",
    "* Submit Python functions with the [submit() function or the map() function]().\n",
    "* Support for parallel execution, either using the [message passing interface (MPI)](), [thread based parallelism]() or by [assigning dedicated GPUs]() to selected Python functions. All these resources assignments are handled via the [resource dictionary parameter resource_dict]().\n",

    "## SLURM\n",
    "With the [Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM)](https://slurm.schedmd.com/) currently being the most commonly used job scheduler, executorlib provides an interface to submit Python functions to SLURM. Internally, this is based on the [srun](https://slurm.schedmd.com/srun.html) command of the SLURM scheduler, which creates job steps in a given allocation. Given that all resource requests in SLURM are communicated via a central database a large number of submitted Python functions and resulting job steps can slow down the performance of SLURM. To address this limitation it is recommended to install the hierarchical job scheduler [flux](https://flux-framework.org/) in addition to SLURM, to use flux for distributing the resources within a given allocation. This configuration is discussed in more detail below in the section [SLURM with flux]()."

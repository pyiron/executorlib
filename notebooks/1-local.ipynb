    "# Local Mode\n",
    "The local mode in executorlib, which is selected by setting the `backend` parameter to `\"local\"`, is primarily used to enable rapid prototyping on a workstation computer to test your parallel Python program with executorlib before transferring it to an high performance computer (HPC). When the `backend` parameter is not set, it defaults to `\"local\"`. With the added capability of executorlib it is typically 10% slower than the [ProcessPoolExecutor](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#processpoolexecutor) from the Python standard library on a single node, when all acceleration features are enabled. This overhead is primarily related to the creation of new tasks. So the performance of executorlib improves when the individual Python function calls require extensive computations. \n",

This enables the use of dynamically defined Python functions for example in the case of a Jupyter notebook. "

    "### Cache\n",
    "The development of scientific workflows is commonly an interactive process, extending the functionality step by step. This lead to the development of interactive environments like [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) which is fully supported by executorlib. Still many of the computationally intensive Python functions can take in the order of minutes to hours or even longer to execute, so reusing an existing Python process is not feasible. To address this challenge executorlib provides a file based cache to store the results of previously computed [concurrent future Futures](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#future-objects) objects. The results are serialized using [cloudpickle](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle) and stored in a user-defined cache directory `cache_directory` to be reloaded later on. Internally, the hierarchical data format (HDF5) is used via the [h5py](https://www.h5py.org), which is an optional dependency for executorlib. \n",

class Executor:
    """
    The pympipool.Executor leverages either the message passing interface (MPI), the SLURM workload manager or preferable
    the flux framework for distributing python functions within a given resource allocation. In contrast to the
    mpi4py.futures.MPIPoolExecutor the pympipool.Executor can be executed in a serial python process and does not
    require the python script to be executed with MPI. It is even possible to execute the pympipool.Executor directly in
    an interactive Jupyter notebook.

    Args:
        max_cores (int): defines the number cores which can be used in parallel
        cores_per_worker (int): number of MPI cores to be used for each function call
        threads_per_core (int): number of OpenMP threads to be used for each function call
        gpus_per_worker (int): number of GPUs per worker - defaults to 0
        oversubscribe (bool): adds the `--oversubscribe` command line flag (OpenMPI and SLURM only) - default False
        cwd (str/None): current working directory where the parallel python task is executed
        hostname_localhost (boolean): use localhost instead of the hostname to establish the zmq connection. In the
                                      context of an HPC cluster this essential to be able to communicate to an
                                      Executor running on a different compute node within the same allocation. And
                                      in principle any computer should be able to resolve that their own hostname
                                      points to the same address as localhost. Still MacOS >= 12 seems to disable
                                      this look up for security reasons. So on MacOS it is required to set this
                                      option to true
        backend (str): Switch between the different backends "flux", "mpi" or "slurm". Alternatively, when "auto"
                       is selected (the default) the available backend is determined automatically.
        block_allocation (boolean): To accelerate the submission of a series of python functions with the same resource
                                    requirements, pympipool supports block allocation. In this case all resources have
                                    to be defined on the executor, rather than during the submission of the individual
                                    function.
        init_function (None): optional function to preset arguments for functions which are submitted later
        command_line_argument_lst (list): Additional command line arguments for the srun call (SLURM only)

        Instead of returning a pympipool.Executor object this function returns either a pympipool.mpi.PyMPIExecutor,

        pympipool.flux.PyFluxExecutor is the preferred choice while the pympipool.mpi.PyMPIExecutor is primarily used
        for development and testing. The pympipool.flux.PyFluxExecutor requires flux-core from the flux-framework to be
        installed and in addition flux-sched to enable GPU scheduling. Finally, the pympipool.slurm.PySlurmExecutor
        requires the SLURM workload manager to be installed on the system.

    The executorlib.interactive.executor.InteractiveStepExecutor leverages the executorlib interfaces to distribute python
    tasks. In contrast to the mpi4py.futures.MPIPoolExecutor the executorlib.interactive.executor.InteractiveStepExecutor
    can be executed in a serial python process and does not require the python script to be executed with MPI.
    Consequently, it is primarily an abstraction of its functionality to improve the usability in particular when used
    in combination with Jupyter notebooks.

## Challenges
In high performance computing (HPC) the Python programming language is commonly used as high-level language to
orchestrate the coupling of scientific applications. Still the efficient usage of highly parallel HPC clusters remains
challenging, in primarily three aspects:

* **Communication**: Distributing python function calls over hundreds of compute node and gathering the results on a
  shared file system is technically possible, but highly inefficient. A socket-based communication approach is 
  preferable.
* **Resource Management**: Assigning Python functions to GPUs or executing Python functions on multiple CPUs using the 
  message passing interface (MPI) requires major modifications to the python workflow.
* **Integration**: Existing workflow libraries implement a secondary the job management on the Python level rather than
  leveraging the existing infrastructure provided by the job scheduler of the HPC.

### executorlib is ...
In a given HPC allocation the `executorlib` library addresses these challenges by extending the Executor interface
of the standard Python library to support the resource assignment in the HPC context. Computing resources can either be
assigned on a per function call basis or as a block allocation on a per Executor basis. The `executorlib` library
is built on top of the [flux-framework](https://flux-framework.org) to enable fine-grained resource assignment. In
addition, [Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM)](https://slurm.schedmd.com) is supported as alternative
queuing system and for workstation installations `executorlib` can be installed without a job scheduler.

### executorlib is not ...
The executorlib library is not designed to request an allocation from the job scheduler of an HPC. Instead within a given
allocation from the job scheduler the `executorlib` library can be employed to distribute a series of python
function calls over the available computing resources to achieve maximum computing resource utilization.

## Example
The following examples illustrates how `executorlib` can be used to distribute a series of MPI parallel function calls 
within a queuing system allocation. `example.py`:
```python
import flux.job
from executorlib import Executor

def calc(i):
    from mpi4py import MPI
    size = MPI.COMM_WORLD.Get_size()
    rank = MPI.COMM_WORLD.Get_rank()
    return i, size, rank

with flux.job.FluxExecutor() as flux_exe:
    with Executor(max_cores=2, executor=flux_exe, resource_dict={"cores": 2}) as exe:
        fs = exe.submit(calc, 3)
        print(fs.result())
```
This example can be executed using:
```
python example.py
```
Which returns:
```
>>> [(0, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1)], [(1, 2, 0), (1, 2, 1)]
```
The important part in this example is that [mpi4py](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io) is only used in the `calc()`
function, not in the python script, consequently it is not necessary to call the script with `mpiexec` but instead
a call with the regular python interpreter is sufficient. This highlights how `executorlib` allows the users to
parallelize one function at a time and not having to convert their whole workflow to use [mpi4py](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io).
The same code can also be executed inside a jupyter notebook directly which enables an interactive development process.

The interface of the standard [concurrent.futures.Executor](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#module-concurrent.futures)
is extended by adding the option `cores_per_worker=2` to assign multiple MPI ranks to each function call. To create two 
workers the maximum number of cores can be increased to `max_cores=4`. In this case each worker receives two cores
resulting in a total of four CPU cores being utilized.

After submitting the function `calc()` with the corresponding parameter to the executor `exe.submit(calc, 0)`
a python [`concurrent.futures.Future`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#future-objects) is
returned. Consequently, the `executorlib.Executor` can be used as a drop-in replacement for the
[`concurrent.futures.Executor`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#module-concurrent.futures)
which allows the user to add parallelism to their workflow one function at a time.
